# Bugatti-Newsroom-Page
This is a Bugatti Newsroom Web page clone.  
It is a static webpage built completely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice advanced HTML and CSS topics like:- 
  1. Semantic HTML.
  2. ARIA Tags.
  3. Responsive Images using HTML (Resolution Switching).
  4. Highely nested CSS flexbox and Grid layout with grid areas.
  5. Desktop First approach with full responsiveness to mobile viewports. 

  Through this project I have learned about Accessibility, ARIA tags, Semantics, Focus Trapping.
